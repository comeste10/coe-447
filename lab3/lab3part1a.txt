Question 1: What is the address of the byte with value 0x19?

	It is located in the left most byte of the word with address 0x10010000 (byte #3).

Question 2: What is now the address of the byte with value 0x19?

	It is now located in the right most byte of the word with address 0x10010000 (byte #0).

Question 3: Is the simulator little endian or big endian? How can you tell?
	
	The simulator is little endian. I can tell because it addresses the bytes in
	reverse order when a number is loaded in byte instead of as a single word.
